# Control Unit Operation and Microprogrammed Control
If we know the ISA, then we know the functions that the processor must perform. However, we also need to know the external interfaces, usually through a bus, and how interrupts are handled. The following list of things are needed to specify the function of the processor:
- Operations (opcodes)
- Addressing modes
- Registers
- I/O module interface
- Memory module interface
- Interrupts
